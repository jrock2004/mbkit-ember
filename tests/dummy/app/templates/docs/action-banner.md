# Action Banner

Action Banners are full width banners that usually appear above the site header. They span the full window width and are dismissible.

They come in two variants: **Warning** and **Error.**

## Best Practices

- Include an icon to the left of the copy
- Copy and icon are centered within the banner
- Do not include marketing content
- Content should alert the user to a system or account status
- Action Banners do not appear based on a userâ€™s action
